# Code beautifully crafted by Tiago Ribeiro
# I'm still trying to learn Python and I stuggled and learned quite a bit to make this program.
# Can't wait to look back at this in 5 years and realise how little I actually knew, and see how much I've grown since.
# 
# Farmer Simulator Beta Version - 0.1
# In this Farmer Simulator program you are a simple virtual farmer that will use commands
# to buy goods to be able to grow, harvest and sell crops to upgrade and pimp out your farm.
