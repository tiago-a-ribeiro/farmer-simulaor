# farmer-simulator
This is a simple little program I made to experiment with python and to have a little fun.

Instructions:
1) Make sure to have all .py files dowloaded in one folder/directory
2) Run the "Game.py" file with python3
3) Enjoy the game!

When you must type commands you can either have caps lock on or off (your preference). The program will convert the input to uppercase automatically. I recommend going to the shop at the beginning as a first step and buying as many seeds as you can. If the shop happens to not be selling any seeds, don't worry. They're randomly generated every day so EXIT the shop and go to SLEEP, hopefully the shop will be selling seeds!

You must keep track of the plants you watered as the game won't tell you! When a plant is still young it's icon will be the lowercase of the first character of that plants name. It will be ready to harvest when the icon is capital. 
 
 **| - |** means the plot is empty and untilled.   
 **| ~ |** means the plot is tilled.
